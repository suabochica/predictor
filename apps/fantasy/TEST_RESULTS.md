## Phase 1 Test Run — 2026-04-04

### Scenario 1 — Registration
PASS

### Scenario 2 — Login & Session
PASS

### Scenario 3 — Route Guards
PASS

### Scenario 4 — Header
PASS

### Scenario 5 — Sidebar
### FAIL — Phase 1 / Scenario 5.4
**Step:** 5.4
**Action:** In Supabase, set a transfer window with `open_at <= NOW() <= close_at`
**Expected:** "Transfers open" badge appears in sidebar
**Actual:** Badge did not appear when updating `opens_at`/`closes_at` to straddle NOW(). App queries transfer windows using `&is_active=eq.true` — it checks the `is_active` boolean column, not the time range columns. Badge only appears when `is_active` is set to `true` directly.
**Console errors:**
  None
**Network response (if relevant):**
  GET `.../transfer_windows?select=*&is_active=eq.true` — returns empty when is_active=false, even if time range is current
**Notes:**
  The test guide assumes time-based logic but the implementation uses a boolean flag. Either the test guide or the implementation needs to be aligned. Workaround: set `is_active = true` directly in the Table Editor.

### Scenario 6 — MobileNav
PASS

### Scenario 7 — Dashboard
PASS

### Scenario 8 — LeagueContext

### FAIL — Phase 1 / Scenario 8.3
**Step:** 8.3
**Action:** Log in with a user who has no `teams` row
**Expected:** App does not crash; budget shows blank or zero
**Actual:** App does not crash, but dashboard shows `105.0M` budget remaining — a hardcoded default value is displayed instead of blank or zero
**Console errors:**
  None
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  The app appears to fall back to a hardcoded default of 105.0 when no `teams` row exists for the logged-in user. This could mislead users into thinking they have a budget when no team has been set up.

Steps 8.1, 8.2, and 8.4 — IN PROGRESS

### Scenario 9 — usePlayers Filters
PASS (step 9.5 deferred to Phase 3 as documented)

### Scenario 10 — RLS Policies
PASS

- 10.1 — logged-in user can only read their own team ✅
- 10.2 — querying another user's team returns empty array ✅
- 10.3 — inserting into team_players with another user's team_id returns 403 RLS error ✅
- 10.4 — any authenticated user can read all players (25 returned) ✅
- 10.5 — non-admin insert into players returns 403 RLS error ✅
- 10.6 — admin insert verified via CSV import earlier in setup ✅
- 10.7 — fantasy_standings readable by authenticated user (empty table, no error) ✅
- 10.8 — matchdays readable by authenticated user (7 rows returned) ✅

### Scenario 11 — Database Functions
PASS

- 11.1 — FWD with 90 min, 1 goal, 1 assist, clean sheet = 9 pts ✅
- 11.2 — GK with 60 min, 4 saves, clean sheet = 7 pts ✅
- 11.3 — refresh_player_points updates total_points for all players in matchday ✅
- 11.4 — yellow card deducts 1 point (9 → 8) ✅
- 11.5 — red card deducts 3 points (9 → 6) ✅

### Scenario 12 — Lib Utilities

PASS with one bug and two test guide mismatches noted below.

#### scoring.js — calculatePlayerPoints
- GK, 90 min, clean sheet, 3 saves = 7 ✅
- FWD, 60 min, 2 goals, 1 assist = 13 ✅
- DEF, 45 min, 1 own goal = -1 ✅
- MID, 90 min, yellow card = 1 ✅
- Captain multiplier (10) = 20 ✅

### FAIL — Phase 1 / Scenario 12 — scoring.js
**Step:** 12 (scoring.js)
**Action:** Call `calculatePlayerPoints` with partial stats object (missing penalty_saves, penalty_misses etc.)
**Expected:** Function handles missing fields gracefully, defaults to 0
**Actual:** Returns `NaN` when optional fields like `penalty_saves`, `penalty_misses`, `own_goals` etc. are not provided
**Console errors:**
  None — silent NaN
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  Function requires all stat fields to be present. Should use default values (e.g. `stats.penalty_saves ?? 0`) for optional fields to prevent NaN results.

#### formations.js
- `isValidFormation('4-3-3')` = true ✅
- `isValidFormation('5-5-0')` = false ✅
- `parseFormation('4-3-3')` = `{ GK: 1, DEF: 4, MID: 3, FWD: 3 }` ✅ (includes GK: 1 which is correct)

#### validation.js
- `validateBid(9.0, 8.5, null)` = `{ valid: true }` ✅
- `validateBid(8.0, 8.5, null)` = `{ valid: false }` with correct error ✅
- `validateBudget(110.0, 105.0)` = `{ valid: true }` ✅
- `validateBudget(50.0, 105.0)` = `{ valid: false }` with correct error ✅
- Note: test guide had incorrect parameter order for validateBid — third param is currentHighBid not budget. Function itself is correct.

#### utils.js
- `formatPrice(9.5)` = `9.5M` ✅ (test guide expected `£9.5` — implementation uses M suffix, no £ sign, intentional)
- `formatPoints(123)` = `+123` ✅ (test guide expected `123 pts` — format is intentionally different)
- `sortByTotalPoints` — function correct, sorts by `total_points` field descending ✅

### Scenario 13 — Hooks Deferred to Phase 3
No testing required yet — skip

## Phase 2 Test Run — 2026-04-05

### Scenario 1 — Authentication & Route Guards
PASS

### Scenario 2 — Auction Controls (Admin)
PASS

### Scenario 3 — AuctionTimer

### FAIL — Phase 2 / Scenario 3.1 (AuctionTimer — stuck at 00:00)
**Step:** 3.1
**Action:** With auction active, observe timer on `/auction`
**Expected:** Timer counts down from full duration (3:00), colour is emerald
**Actual:** Timer displays `00:00` and does not count down. `auction_state` confirmed correct in Supabase: `status=active`, `round_duration_seconds=180`, `round_started_at=2026-04-05 07:54:11.339`.
**Console errors:**
  None observed
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  Likely cause: timezone mismatch. Supabase returns `round_started_at` as a UTC timestamp without a `Z` suffix. If the timer component parses it with `new Date(round_started_at)`, JavaScript may treat it as local time, making the elapsed time calculation produce a value larger than `round_duration_seconds`, clamping remaining time to 0. Fix: ensure `round_started_at` is parsed as UTC (e.g. append `Z` if not present before passing to `new Date()`).

Steps 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 — NOT TESTED. Skipped due to timer being stuck at 00:00 (blocked by 3.1 bug above). Re-test once timer fix is applied.

### Scenario 4 — Placing Bids
PASS

**UX note:** "My Bids" panel title text is black on a dark background — hard to read. Should be white.

### Scenario 5 — Real-time Bid Updates

Steps 5.1 and 5.2 — PASS

### FAIL — Phase 2 / Scenario 5.3 (Real-time Bid Updates — cannot out-bid back)
**Step:** 5.3
**Action:** Regular user attempts to out-bid back after being outbid on a player
**Expected:** Regular user can place a higher bid; My Bids panel flips back to "Leading"
**Actual:** Once a user has been outbid, the bid input is no longer shown on the player card — only an "✗ Outbid — Your bid: £X.X" message is displayed. There is no way to place a follow-up bid on the same player in the same round. Tested with both admin and a second regular user doing the outbidding — same result in both cases.
**Console errors:**
  None
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  May be intentional design (one bid per player per round — commit and wait). The test guide expects out-bidding back to be possible. Needs a design decision: if one-bid-per-player-per-round is intentional, the test guide should be updated; if re-bidding should be allowed, the card needs to re-show the input when the user is outbid.

### FAIL — Phase 2 / Scenario 5 (Security — user with no team can place bids)
**Step:** N/A — discovered during Scenario 5 testing
**Action:** Logged in as a user with no row in the `teams` table and navigated to `/auction`
**Expected:** User without a team should not be able to participate in the auction
**Actual:** User can access the auction page and place bids successfully. No guard or error prevents participation.
**Console errors:**
  None
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  This is related to Known Issue #4 in the build summary ("resolveRound() skips winners with no team row"). A user with no team winning a bid will cause resolution to fail. A pre-auction guard should prevent teamless users from bidding. Fix: check for a valid `teams` row before allowing bid submission, or block access to `/auction` entirely if no team exists.

### Scenario 6 — Tie-break Behaviour

**Test guide mismatch — tie-break scenario not reachable by design.**
The UI enforces a minimum bid increment of £0.3 above the current top bid. Once any user places a bid, the next user's input is floored at `top_bid + 0.3`, making identical bids impossible through normal UI interaction. The tie-break logic in `getHighestBid()` (first bidder wins on equal amounts) is therefore untestable via the front-end and may never trigger in practice. Test guide should be updated to reflect this.

### FAIL — Phase 2 / Scenario 6 (Duplicate bid on same player by same user)
**Step:** N/A — discovered during Scenario 6 testing
**Action:** Due to a brief UI update delay, the same user was able to place two bids on the same player (Theo Hernández) in the same round
**Expected:** A user should only be able to hold one active bid per player per round
**Actual:** Both bids were accepted and both appear in My Bids as "Leading" for the same player, consuming 2 of the 10 available slots
**Console errors:**
  None
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  The 10-bid limit is enforced in `placeBid()` using local state, but there is no check preventing a second bid on a player the user has already bid on. A race condition during UI update allows a second submission before the first bid is reflected in state. Fix: add a per-player-per-user uniqueness check in `placeBid()` before inserting, or add a unique constraint on `(user_id, player_id, round_number)` in the `auction_bids` table.

### Scenario 7 — Round Resolution

Steps 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 — PASS

Steps 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 — PASS
- `auction_state`: round did not advance (stayed on Round 2) due to resolution errors from teamless user winning bids ✅
- `auction_bids`: winning bids correctly marked `is_winning = true` ✅
- `team_players`: 2 rows inserted with correct `team_id`, `acquisition_price`, `is_locked = false`, `slot_type = 'free'` ✅

### FAIL — Phase 2 / Scenario 7.8 (Round Resolution — double budget deduction)
**Step:** 7.8
**Action:** Check `teams.budget_remaining` after resolution
**Expected:** Budget reduced by £23.9 (£12.1 + £11.8), leaving £81.1 remaining from £105.0
**Actual:** Budget shows £57.2 — a reduction of £47.8, exactly double the correct amount
**Console errors:**
  None
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  Matches Known Issue #5 in the build summary: `resolveRound()` was triggered twice — first attempt failed due to teamless user errors, second attempt succeeded, but budget was deducted on both runs. The `team_players` upsert uses `ignoreDuplicates: true` so roster entries were not duplicated, but `budget_remaining` was deducted again on the retry. Do not confirm resolution twice on the same round until this is fixed.

Step 7.9 — NOT TESTED. Timer stuck at 00:00 (blocked by Scenario 3.1 bug) — cannot verify timer resets on round advance.

### Scenario 8 — Resolution Error Cases

**Step 8.1 — PASS** (confirmed during Scenario 7 testing — error panel correctly shows "Winner has no team registered" and round does not advance)

**Step 8.2 — FAIL (blocked)** — Adding a `teams` row for the winning teamless user did not unblock resolution. Root cause: the winning bids were placed via Realtime after page load and lost their joined user data (Known Issue #1). `resolveRound()` receives these bids with winner = `?`, so it cannot match them to any team row regardless of whether one exists. The only workaround during testing was to manually delete the affected bids from Supabase. This is a compounding of Known Issues #1 and #4 — until real-time bids re-fetch their joined data, any bid placed after page load that wins a round will permanently block resolution.

**Step 8.3 — PASS** — Advancing a round with no bids placed works cleanly. Confirmation panel shows no winner rows, round advances with no DB writes.

### FAIL — Phase 2 / Scenario 8 (Won players still appear as biddable in next round)
**Step:** N/A — discovered during Scenario 8 testing
**Action:** Players won by the admin team in a previous round continued to appear in the player grid in the following round with active bid inputs
**Expected:** Won players should be visually distinguished or removed from the grid (noted as a pending decision in Known Issue #6)
**Actual:** Won players appear identically to available players. Attempting to bid on them returns a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error with no user-friendly message.
**Console errors:**
  TypeError: Failed to fetch
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  Two issues here: (1) Known Issue #6 — no visual distinction for won players, decision still pending. (2) The `Failed to fetch` error on bid submission for an already-won player is unhandled — the app should show a meaningful error message rather than a raw TypeError. Fix: catch fetch errors in `placeBid()` and display a user-friendly message; separately, resolve Known Issue #6 by hiding, greying out, or badging won players.

### UX Note — Auction one-bid-per-round mechanic
One-bid-per-player-per-round means a user who is outbid has no recourse until the next round. This may be intentional but has a significant gameplay implication: a user only loses a player if someone outbids them AND that higher bid goes unchallenged for a full round. Consider communicating this mechanic clearly in the UI (e.g. a tooltip or round summary explaining that leading bids at round end win the player).

### Scenario 9 — RLS Policies

Step 9.2 — PASS ✅ Regular user insert with another user's `user_id` blocked with RLS error: "new row violates row-level security policy for table auction_bids"

Step 9.3 — PASS ✅ Admin update of `auction_state` succeeds as expected

### FAIL — Phase 2 / Scenario 9.1 (RLS — regular user can update auction_state)
**Step:** 9.1
**Action:** As regular user, run `supabase.from('auction_state').update({ status: 'completed' }).eq('id', 1)` via Dashboard.jsx console test
**Expected:** Returns RLS error, no change made
**Actual:** Returns `ALLOWED - data:null` — update succeeds. Regular user can modify auction state directly.
**Console errors:**
  None
**Network response (if relevant):**
  N/A
**Notes:**
  The RLS policy on `auction_state` (migration 004_auction_state_rls.sql) should restrict INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to admins only. Either the policy was not applied correctly, or the anon key bypasses it. Verify in Supabase dashboard under Authentication → Policies that the UPDATE policy on `auction_state` has a `is_admin = true` check on the `users` table. Also check that RLS is enabled on the table (not just policies defined).

BUGs

-in the auction if outbid in a round when resolving it just gives the player to the higest bidder. if more than one has bid on a player, it has to go to a new round to give the oportunity to outbid. the only way to win a player is complete a round being the only one bidding. if more than one bid on a player, the new round starts with the higest bid attached.
-it allows to change the GK out and have a lineup with no GK- that is an error.
- I saved lineups for everyone, but we should test what happens if a user forgets to save, when the matchday starts it should auto save everybody.(it did save but the users with a saved linup, dummy users didnt save their lineups. and now they have 2 saved linups? first saved lineup before admin activating the matchday was saved with matchday_id = NULL. that is a mistake. maybe once the auction is done the first matchday should be activated, once the first matchday is marked complete the second should be automatically activated and that way we dont have empty timeframes of activated matchdays. also lineup managemtn needs further thought, because users can change many times their lineups, for historical approach the linup at the end of the matchday should be saved with a special indicator, during the matchday it has to be saved and updated?
- after the points are calculated, the points appear in the "my team" section and some players have lock sign on them and others not, but some with the lock have not played yet and some wihtout the lock have poitns so it is unclear, it should be lcoked if they have played and have points. seems like a bug
